# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Andrew

I'm currently a 2nd-year Ph.D student at the University of Georgia studying stellar flares of young stars.

## ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently working on
- For my Ph.D: the flaring activity of young stars within Nearby Young Moving Groups (NYMGs) as well as open clusters and field stars
- For my personal projects: the intersection between AI/ML and finance, and general computing applications in cosmology
